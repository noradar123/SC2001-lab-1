This is a simple project comparing a hybrid sort (insertion + merge) and pure merge sort.
"mergesort array" contains the pure mergesort which outputs the sorted array and "combination array" is the hybrid algorithm which outputs the same thing.
"time complexity 1" shows a diagram of key comparisons to array size of hybrid algorithm, "time complexity 2" shows a diagram of key comparisons to threshold, and "time complexity 3" shows the comparison between hybrid and merge sort.
